            <h4>Our small shop was born and raised in NYC. We draw inspiration from not only
                <br>
                the video games, manga, anime and pop culture exhibited from our products and their 
                <br>
                descriptions, but from the culture of this great city as well.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our goal is to share our love and interest for these amazing art forms in new 
                <br>
                and creative ways never seen before. What better way to do that than
                <br>
                through the one art form almost everyone can agree on:
                <br>
